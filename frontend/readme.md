# Rauxa frontend

### Run

Just host the folder and configure a CDN

### All js scripts are
`js/moduleName/*.js`

#### configure it
`js/config.js`


### Can be better

* can be build with reactjs, vuejs, angular, etc.
* using CDN hard coded for dependencies. im aware, because of the server size i can afford in aws.
* built with bootstrap + jquery for timing and project size.
* built with admin template, which has all the components i needed.
